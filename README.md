# Voice-Commerce-Application

A simple yet powerful app that helps you find the perfect pair of shoes using your voice. Instead of just clicking buttons, you can talk to the app to search for styles, colors, or brands.

# 📝 Project Description
This is a modern web application built with React and TypeScript. It uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to understand what you're looking for. It connects to smart services like Gemini and Groq to make shopping feel more like a conversation than a search.

# ✨ Key Features
1.**Voice Search:** Use your microphone to find shoes instead of typing.

2.**Multilingual Support:** Talk or search in your preferred language—the AI understands and responds across different languages.

3.**Lightning-Fast Voice Processing:** Uses Groq STT (Whisper Large v3) to convert speech to text in milliseconds.

4.**Intelligent Attribute Extraction:** Passes the transcribed text to Gemini LLM, which automatically identifies:

**Style:** Sneakers, Boots, Running shoes.

**Details:** Size, Color, Brand, and Gender.

5.**Detailed Views:** Get a close-up look at every shoe with specific product details.

# 🛠️ Requirements
To run this project on your computer, you will need:

Node.js installed (this runs the code).

API Keys for Gemini and Groq (these are the "brains" of the app).

A Web Browser with microphone access (for the voice features).

# 🚀 How to Start
Download the code to your computer.

Install the tools by typing npm install in your terminal.

Add Keys: Put your AI keys in a file named .env.

Launch: Type npm run dev to see the app in your browser.
